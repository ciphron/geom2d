geom2d is a Python module that provides an abstraction called a Plane for drawing 2D geometry using floating point coordinates. Some implementations of Plane are provided. For vector graphics, we have SVGPlane for drawing to an SVG file. For raster graphics, we have RasterPlane that draws to a Raster along with an implementation of Raster, ImageRaster that writes to an image file. See the included file example.py which demonstrates a simple use of geom2d.
